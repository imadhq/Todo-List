# Todo-List
This project is part of my learning journey with The Odin Project curriculum.

**Project Overview**
- This project is a simple to-do list application built for the web. Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks organized within projects. The application utilizes local storage for data persistence and employs the date-fns API for date formatting.

**Key Objectives**
- Implement dynamic creation of to-do objects using factories or constructors/classes.
- Define properties for to-do items including title, due date, and priority.
- Organize to-dos into projects or separate lists.
- Separate application logic from DOM-related functions using modularization.
- Design a user interface allowing users to view all projects and their respective to-dos and the ability to edit and delete to-dos.
- Utilize local storage for data persistence using the Web Storage API.
- Incorporate the date-fns library for date manipulation.

**Development Notes**
- Faced a lot of hurdles due to underestimating the complexity of the project scope. What seemed like a simple to-do project actually hit me quite a few times. This led me to remove some initially planned features to focus on core functionality.
- Local storage is not implemented in the main task folder, but is used in all other folders created. The default folder can be used for demo purposes.
- Definitely improved my understanding of webpack through this project compared to my previous project the Restaurant Page.
- Attempts were made to avoid repetition, although some instances of violating the DRY principle exist, such as repetitive creation of modal instances.
- Future iterations of the project may be considered to incorporate more advanced programming concepts and address existing challenges.

- This project was really difficult and taught me a lot, I would like to comeback to this further on in my learning journey in hopes to refactor it in a more concise and efficient way.
